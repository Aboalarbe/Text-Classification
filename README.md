# Text Classification

Text classification is one of the major tasks of AI in general, NLP in particular. Having five Gutenberg books, this report discusses the methodologies and models with different transformation techniques that have been applied to reach the best accuracy that the champion model achieves by correctly classifying unseen text to the corresponding book.


## Introduction
Text can be a rich source of information, however extracting insights from it is not an easy task due to its unstructured nature. The overall objective is to produce classification predictions and compare them; analyze the pros and cons of algorithms and generate and communicate the insights so, the implementation is needed to check the accuracy of each model going to be used and select the champion model. the best language to be used in such problems is python with its vast libraries.

## Dataset
The Gutenberg dataset represents a corpus of over 60,000 book texts, their authors and titles. The data has been scraped from the Project Gutenberg website using a custom script to parse all bookshelves. we have taken five different samples of Gutenberg digital books that are of five different authors, that we think are of the criminal same genre and are semantically the same. The books are Criminal Sociology by Enrico Ferri. Crime: Its Cause and Treatment by Clarence Darrow. The Pirates' Who's Who by Philip Gosse. Celebrated Crimes by Alexandre Dumas and Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts by Frank Richard.
